  Foreground wrapper for the adaptive icon.

  Android adaptive icon canvas = 108dp x 108dp.
  Safe/visible zone            =  72dp x 72dp (center).
  Outer 18dp on each side is clipped by the launcher mask.

  To zoom the icon OUT (make it appear smaller with breathing room),
  we add insets so the actual artwork sits comfortably inside the safe zone.

  inset = 22dp on all sides  →  artwork occupies 64dp of the 108dp canvas
  This keeps the icon well within the safe zone with nice padding.
  Increase inset to zoom out more, decrease to zoom in more.
